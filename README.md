# Data Analysis Projects Repository

Welcome to my data analysis projects repository! This repository contains a collection of projects focused on various aspects of data analysis, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling. The projects are organized by language and stored in corresponding folders. You can find projects in both Russian (RU) and English (EN).

## Structure

The repository is structured into two main folders:

- **RU/** – Contains data analysis projects written in Russian.
- **EN/** – Contains data analysis projects written in English.

Each folder contains multiple projects that are based on different datasets and explore various methodologies of data analysis.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Navigate to the folder of interest**:
   - If you prefer projects in Russian, go to the `RU/` folder.
   - For English-language projects, navigate to the `EN/` folder.

2. **Each project has its own folder**:
   - Inside each folder, you will find the project's main Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) or Python scripts (`.py`), along with the dataset (if publicly available) and any necessary supplementary files.

3. **Run and review the code**:
   - Feel free to run the code on your own machine or in a cloud environment (like Google Colab).
   - Most projects come with a detailed explanation of the steps and insights gained during the analysis.

## Requirements

For each project, a `requirements.txt` file may be provided that lists the necessary Python libraries for running the code. Here are some common libraries used across many projects:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow` (for deep learning-related projects)

You can install the required dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Projects Overview

Here is a brief overview of the types of projects you can find in this repository:

### Russian Projects (RU/)
- **[Project 1 Title]** – Описание проекта 1: что исследовалось и какие результаты были достигнуты.
- **[Project 2 Title]** – Описание проекта 2: основные подходы и полученные выводы.

### English Projects (EN/)
- **[Project 1 Title]** – A brief description of the project, what was analyzed, and key results.
- **[Project 2 Title]** – Summary of the second project with methodologies and insights.
